# GDPR Compliance

## Project Explanation and Functionalities

The project is a comprehensive hospital management system with both frontend and backend components. It includes functionalities for managing hospital operations, patient records, and administrative tasks. The `3DHospitalModel` directory suggests that there is a 3D model of the hospital for visualization purposes. The `Backend` and `Frontend` directories indicate a separation of concerns, with the backend handling data processing and storage, and the frontend providing the user interface.

## Personal Data Processed by the Prototype

The personal data that may be processed by the prototype includes:
- Patient names
- Contact information (phone numbers, email addresses)
- Medical records (diagnoses, treatment plans, medical history)
- Insurance information
- Appointment details

## Data Processing Activities

The data processing activities that the prototype may perform include:
- Collecting patient information during registration
- Storing medical records in a database
- Updating patient information as needed
- Retrieving patient records for healthcare providers
- Deleting patient records when they are no longer needed
- Sharing patient information with authorized personnel

## Lawful Basis for Processing Personal Data

The lawful basis for processing personal data in this project includes:
- **Consent**: Patients provide explicit consent for their data to be collected and processed.
- **Contract**: Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the patient (e.g., providing healthcare services).
- **Legal Obligation**: Processing is necessary to comply with legal obligations (e.g., reporting certain diseases to health authorities).
- **Vital Interests**: Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the patient or another person (e.g., in a medical emergency).
- **Public Task**: Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority (e.g., public health monitoring).

These bases align with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant data protection laws. It is important for the team to ensure that all data processing activities are documented and that patients are informed about how their data will be used.
